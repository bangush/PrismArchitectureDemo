# Prism Architecture Demo
An example of how you might structure a PRISM based application.  This is currently using PRISM 6.3.0 and targets full fat .NET Framework v4.7.2.

# Goals
The general goal here is to offer a relatively simple but also comprehensive starting point for a WPF / MVVM / PRISM based application.

If you're just getting started with any of these technologies there is a lot to get your head around. Lots of demos can be really helpful but can also suffer a bit with complexity which I'm hoping to avoid here.

# Features
- Basic bootstrapping
- Styling
- MVVM Base View Models (Basic Lightweight and DependencyObject)
